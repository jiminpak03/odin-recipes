        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A grilled cheese is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>4 slices</strong> white bread</li>
                <li><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> butter, <em>divided</em></li>
                <li><strong>2 slices</strong> cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
                <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
